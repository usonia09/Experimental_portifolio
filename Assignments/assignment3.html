        <h2>Phase One: Sketching Visualizations</h2>
        <article>
          <strong>Initial Question:</strong> What specific trends and shifts in
          the demographic composition, such as age and gender distribution, can
          be identified in the United States based on the 1900 and 2000 data?
          What patterns emerge during the specific periods? How does the
          demographic landscape in 2000 compare to that of 1900, and are there
          any notable patterns that require further investigation?
        </article>

        <h3>Sketch 1</h3>
        <figure>
          <img src="/Assignments/images/image1.jpg" alt="" width="100%" />
          <figcaption>

            for the year 1900 and 2000
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p><strong>Design Rationale</strong></p>

        In the above sketch I aimed to highlight the noteworthy changes in
        population distribution particularly the significant increase in the
        year 2000 compared to the 1900. Notably, the age group of 30-50 exhibts
        the highest population count in 2000, in stark contrast to 1900, where
        there was consistent decline in count as age increased. The following
        rationales elucidate the design choices made to achieve this goal:

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Utilization of Histograms:</strong> The choice of histograms
            was deliberate, as they excel in capturing the distribution of data.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong
              >Vertical Stacking the Histograms and having the same axis
              scalings:</strong
            >
            The histograms were vertically stacked with the same scaling, not
            only to emphasize the comparison of distribution between the two
            years but also to intuitively represent the progression of age.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Incorporation of Stacked Bar Format:</strong> The histograms
            were crafted in a stacked bar format to facilitate the depiction of
            distribution across different genders, adding an extra layer of
            insight to the visual representation.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          While these choices allowed for a comprehensive capture of the overall
          distribution, it's noted that the gender distribution might not be as
          emphasized in the graph. Consequently, in the next sketch I aim to
          delve deeper into the population distribution across age groups, with
          a specific focus on gender-specific trends.
        </p>
        <h3>Sketch 2</h3>
        <figure>
          <img src="/Assignments/images/image2.jpg" alt="" width="100%" />
          <figcaption>
            This sketch attempts to compare gender-specific population trends
            across age groups in the years 1900 and 2000
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p><strong>Design Rationale</strong></p>

        As previously mentioned, the objective of this second sketch is to delve
        into gender trends across the years 1900 and 2000. To achieve this
        exploration, the following choices were carefully considered:

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Selection of the Line Charts:</strong> This choice aims to
            enhance the clarity of trend depiction within and across gender
            groups. Placing the trends together in a single chart could
            potentially result in intersecting lines and a more challenging
            interpretation. The intention is to guide users to focus on one
            trend at a time—first examining the trend within the male
            population, then within the female population, and finally across
            both genders.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Utilization of Multi-Line Charts:</strong> Line charts were
            chosen for their effectiveness in facilitating trend comparison
            across various age groups.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          While the multi-line chart design aided in easy dissection, it
          introduced a potential for misinterpretation, especially if not
          scrutinized carefully due to the scale breaking required. In the next
          sketch, I would like to bring more attentional to the total population
          transformation across age segments.
        </p>

        <h3>Sketch 3</h3>
        <figure>
          <img src="/Assignments/images/image3.jpg" alt="" width="100%" />
          <figcaption>
            This sketch shows how the population across different age groups has
            evolved over the two years: 1900 and 2000
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Design Rationale</p>

        In crafting this sketch, my aim was to visually convey the substantial
        population increase observed across all age groups. The design choices
        for this sketch were guided by the following rationales:

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Aggregation of Consecutive Years: </strong> To enhance
            interpretability and streamline data presentation, I opted to
            aggregate two consecutive years, shifting from a 5-year to a 10-year
            range. This adjustment made the visualization less cumbersome while
            maintaining the integrity of the intended outcome.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Utilization of Horizontal Stacked Graphs: </strong>The
            decision to use horizontally stacked bar charts was motivated by the
            desire to direct focus comparison on population size within each age
            group across the year 1900 and 2000.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          While the horizontal bar charts effectively highlighted the magnitude
          of the population increase in 2000 compared to 1900, I recognized a
          limitation. The sketch does not provide insights into gender-specific
          trends, and the representation inadvertently dilutes the population
          pattern for 2000. Consequently, it is less evident that the population
          in their 30s and 40s is the highest for the year 2000, prompting a
          consideration for potential refinements in future iterations.
        </p>

        <h3>Reflection</h3>

        <p>
          Each of the three aforementioned sketches possesses its own set of
          strengths and weaknesses, as briefly highlighted. The first sketch
          excels in providing a comprehensive overview of the overall
          distribution but lacks emphasis on gender trends. Conversely, the
          second sketch adeptly represents gender trends; however, the
          introduction of a multi-line chart with two axes raises the potential
          for confusion. Finally, the third sketch effectively showcases the
          population increase in 2000 compared to 1900 but omits any information
          about gender dynamics.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the upcoming phase, my objective is to strike a balance by
          synthesizing elements from the different graphs, aiming for a more
          holistic representation of the dataset. I plan to maintain the
          histogram structure to capture the distribution intricacies, while
          incorporating the line chart to explore gender patterns. To address
          the potential confusion introduced by the multi-line chart, I will
          explore alternative ways of using the line charts. Additionally, I
          plan to experiment with axis scaling and graph positioning to enhance
          the visualization and facilitate a clearer depiction of the observed
          population increase that was previously captured in the third sketch.
