        Proposition: The southern US states persist with the most stringent
        abortion policies
      </h2>

      The chart below reveals a clear positive correlation between abortion
      service availability and the frequency of occurrences. By mapping the
      number of abortion providers to the incidence of abortions in 2017, this
      visualization offers valuable insights into their interconnected
      relationship.

        <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

        <p>
          As highlighted earlier, a discernible positive correlation exists
          between the availability of abortion services and the incidence rates.
          This connection vividly underscores the restrictive nature of abortion
          policies in the southern states of the US, particularly evident in
          their record-low number of abortion services and
          <strong>the highest percentage </strong> of women living in counties
          without a clinic.
        </p>

        <p>
          Moreover, the southern states further emphasize their stringent stance
          by consistently maintaining minimal to no financial contribution
          toward abortion services, with funding remaining
          <strong>absent</strong> from 2010 to 2015. This dual
          restriction—limited service availability and a lack of financial
          support—has led to a significant surge in the percentage of residents
          traveling out of the southern state to seek abortion services.

        <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

        <p>
          Since 2010, the southern states have made efforts to enhance
          accessibility to abortion services. This initiative began with an
          increase in funds allocated to abortion. States such as Texas,
          Alabama, Georgia, and North Carolina, which had previously allocated
          no funds towards abortion in 2010, demonstrated a notable shift by
          increasing their expenditure on abortion services by 2015.
        </p>

        <p>
          This financial commitment was accompanied by a positive quadrupling of
          the change in abortion services. Specifically, the shift in abortion
          services from 2017 to 2020 was four times greater in the positive
          direction compared to the change recorded from 2014 to 2017. These
          adjustments are reflected in the increased rates of abortion in the
          southern states, positioning them with comparatively higher abortion
          rates.

                abortion, creating a visual impact. However, the deception lies
                in the fact that the actual increase may not be as substantial.
                The decision to use color coding was preferred over bubble size,
                as the latter would reveal a more accurate representation of the
                minimal increase, contradicting the intended narrative.

                range. The upward arrow serves to overemphasize the positive
                trend, drawing the viewer's attention even farther away from the

        <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

        <p>
          In the process of crafting both visualizations, I discovered that a
          profound understanding of the data serves a dual purpose: it not only
          enables deceptive manipulation but also safeguards against
          unintentional deception. While immersed in the data, discrepancies
          between results and data references prompted a careful examination to
          discern if I misrepresented the data or if inaccuracies stemmed from
          the references. Once I achieved a precise understanding of the data,
          selecting the appropriate manipulation to shape the visualization's
          narrative became more straightforward.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my revised perspective on ethical analysis and visualization, the
          emphasis shifted toward presenting the data as is, minimizing
          unnecessary interpretation for the reader. I recognized potential
          pitfalls in interpretations, such as emphasizing trends, selecting
          colors or wording, or excluding context. However, I acknowledge that
          each visualization carries a specific message, and removing such
          elements could risk losing that intended message. Additionally,
          providing readers complete freedom in their interpretations does not
          guarantee the most accurate understanding.
        </p>
        <p>
          Consequently, I assert that ethical analysis involves transparently
          representing the data and providing essential context for a deeper
          comprehension. By presenting the data as is, accompanied by relevant
          context, ethical analysis promotes a more informed and responsible
          interpretation by the audience.
