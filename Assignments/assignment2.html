        <h2>Subtheme: Condo Conversions</h2>
        <h3>Dataset: Condo conversions in the City of Boston</h3>

        <p>
          This dataset contains data about different types of properties
          converted into condos from 2015-2024 in Boston. For each condo
          conversion, the dataset includes data from the year just prior to the
          conversion and the year after the conversion. It includes details
          about property and land value, property condition, property type,
          other details.
        </p>

        <h3>Initial Analysis Questions</h3>
        <ol>
          <b
            ><li>
              How has condo conversions impacted the availability of spaces for
              residential use?
            </li></b

          <p>
            <b><i>Motivation: </i></b>
            With various properties undergoing condo conversion, I am interested
            in investigating how these has impact availability of spaces for
            residential use. Has the conversion of properties such as family
            home to condos increased available residential spaces? What
            implications does it have on the resulting condos?
          </p>

          <b
            ><li>
              Who are buying the new condos? Are they previous residents?
            </li></b
          >
          <p>
            <b><i>Motivation: </i></b>
            In the article discussing Millbrook's condominium conversion,
            Berkeley Investments asserted that Millbrook was often the final
            destination for homebuyers. I am curious to investigate whether
            locations undergoing condo conversions indeed exhibit a higher
            percentage of residents contemplating the purchase of a house in the
            near future and if these condos are being priced with the current
            residents' financial capability in mind (<a

              >source</a

          </p>

          <b><li>What factors affect the rate of Condo conversions?</li></b>
          <p>
            <b><i>Motivation: </i></b>
            In the reading, Homes for Profits, it is mentioned that investor
            activity is most likely to occur in the region's high-density urban
            submarket with relatively low housing price (<a
              href="https://homesforprofit.mapc.org/report"
              >source</a
            >). However, are there other underlying factors -- other than
            housing prices -- that might motivate condo conversions.

        <h2>Discoveries & Insights</h2>

        The process is initiated with a sanity check on the data, aiming to
        detect and resolve any potential data quality issues that may arise.
        Once confident in the improved quality of the data, I will then proceed
        to utilize it for exploring the aforementioned questions.

        In observing the general trend in number of condos units
        post-conversion. An immediate observation is the lack of data for the
        year 2018. This appeared unusual as it suggest no condo conversion
        occured in 2017. It seems to be more plausible that this is a data gap
        rather than an actual absence of condo conversion. Therefore, the data
        was filtered to include instances with prior year from 2018 onwards to
        account for the missing data issue. This approach aims to leverage
        complete data coverage throughout a contiguous period, 2018-2024.

        Further data scrutinization once again reveals another data quality
        issues.

          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        The noticeable gap in our data is primarily evident in the information
        for the year 2021. Unlike our previous approach, we cannot simply
        eliminate everything before 2021, as doing so would result in the loss
        of a significant amount of valuable data. Additionally, there may be
        other years with missing data that are less conspicuous. To address this
        issue, we plan to filter out data with incomplete post-property value
        information selectively during specific analyses that rely on that
        aspect.

        <p>
          Having addressed data quality issues, we now embark on the exploration
          of the questions initially posed.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img
            src="https://usonia09.github.io/Experimental_portifolio/Assignments/images/residential_count.png"

            designated for residential use before and after conversion.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        Our initial question was how condo conversions impact(ed) the
        availability of spaces for residential use. The chart above illustrates
        that, following the condo conversion, both the count of residential
        units and the number of floors designated for residential use are
        higher. However, the gap for the residential units is significantly
        higher than that for residential floors. What might that mean?

        <figure>
          <img
            src="https://usonia09.github.io/Experimental_portifolio/Assignments/images/aggregated.png"
            alt=""
            width="100%"
          />
          <img
            src="https://usonia09.github.io/Experimental_portifolio/Assignments/images/aggregate_sum.png"
            alt=""
            width="100%"
          />
          <figcaption>

          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        The chart shows the contribution of different building type to the
        number of residential units post conversion. The building type has been
        filtered to display only the property which had no residential units
        before the conversion.

        <p>
          The figure highlights a notable contribution by these propreties as
          shown by their aggregated contribution. This contribution helps
          explain the significant disparity in the number of residential units
          before and after conversion, underscoring that a considerable portion
          of the converted buildings initially lacked residential units prior to
          the conversion.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img

          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        Another follow-up that had arised is the implications of the condo
        conversion on the structure and conditions of the resulting condo. The
        chart above demonstrate a consistent downfall in the facilities like
        parking space and baths.

        <figure>

          <figcaption>

          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        Transitioning to the following question: Who is acquiring the new
        condos, and do they include previous residents? To explore this, we
        delve into the transformations occurring in the properties during
        conversion. The findings reveal a notable decrease in living areas by
        almost half, indicating that these changes might not be as accommodating
        to larger families.

        <figure>
          <img

          />
          <figcaption>Overall property condition post-conversion</figcaption>
        </figure>

        Upon recognizing that condo conversions result in significant losses,
        including parking spaces, living space, and some facilities, we took a
        step back to comprehend the broader impact of these conversions on
        properties. The above two figures depict this assessment. The first one
        illustrates the overall property condition pre-conversion, while the
        second showcases the overall condition post-conversion. Upon comparing
        the two observations, it becomes evident that property conditions, on
        the whole, are generally improved by the conversion.

        <figure>
          <img
            src="https://usonia09.github.io/Experimental_portifolio/Assignments/images/bedroom_cdn.png"
            alt=""
            width="100%"
          />
          <figcaption>
            Illustration of the portion sizes representing bedroom condition of
            properties prior to condo conversion
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        Now, turning to the final question: what factors contribute to condo
        conversions? The chart above delves into the attributes of properties
        undergoing condo conversion. Upon inspecting the diagram, a significant
        portion of bedroom conditions before conversion remains unreported.
        However, the second-largest segment comprises bedrooms in good
        conditions. This raises the question of whether these 'good' conditions
        evolve into 'excellent' conditions post-conversion. Unfortunately,
        further exploration encountered an obstacle due to the unavailability of
        post-condition data for bedrooms. Nonetheless, based on previous
        observations, there are compelling grounds to believe that property
        conditions do not decline. There might indeed be a transformation from
        'good' to at least 'very good,' as indicated by the results from prior
        investigations, particularly the one preceding this analysis.

        <p>
          The above observation does suggest that the investors are interested
          in property that are generally in good shape which makes sense as that
          facilitate the conversion process.

        <h2>Summary</h2>

        <p>
          The investigation into Boston's condo conversion data reveals that
          while such conversions increase residential space, there is a
          trade-off with smaller living spaces, fewer amenities, and parking
          spots. This poses challenges for larger families among the previous
          residents. Paradoxically, despite these reductions, the overall
          condition of converted properties tends to improve. The motivation
          behind condo conversions appears linked to targeting properties in
          good condition, suggesting investor preferences. However, it is
          acknowledged that various factors such as geographic location,
          political atmosphere, and economic considerations also influence
          conversion attractiveness. A more comprehensive analysis requires
          additional data to understand these complexities fully.
